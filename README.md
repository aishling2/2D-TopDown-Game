his is a one‑level cozycore‑style minigame created for my Game AI & Physics module. 
The level features three enemy types with simple AI behaviours, a sword pickup system, and unique attack mechanics.
The player can trigger different animations and sound effects depending on their actions, creating a warm, soft atmosphere with light combat elements.
This prototype focuses on enemy interactions, responsive controls, and small‑scale combat design.
